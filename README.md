# PyMongo
In this project, I created a Python application, using PyMongo, that creates a MongoDB database containing words and their definitions. I then retrieve the data from the collection and displayed a selected wordâ€™s definition.

Steps ->

Prepare the data in JSON format
Create Database and Collection
Populate the Collection using Insert
Query the Collection using Find
Update the Collection
